# VzTxt

VzTxt is a third party tool and programming language for text editing of block based 'vizzy' programs for the game Juno: New Origins.

Features support for both importing and exporting saved XML files. Ideally this allows for 1:1 conversion in and out of game files, but minor changes may still occur.

**Note: Changes to syntax and function names may still occur, WIP state.**

## Syntax

VzTxt is designed as a simple syntax, currently mirroring the functionality of vizzy without expanding on any capabilities.

Currently, for the best demonstration of syntax import existing vizzy programs into the editor.

VzTxt uses a simple syntax with newlines as an instruction terminator. Calls with single arguments are not required to be wrapped in parenthesis, but may be used for clarity. Parenthesis are required to use newlines in expressions.
